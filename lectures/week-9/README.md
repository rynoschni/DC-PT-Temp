# Week 9

Welcome to your Front-End Project! 

For the next 2 weeks, you'll be working on a project that demonstrates the skills you've learned thus far by building an interactive front-end project. We'll explore the Agile methodology for developing software at a high level, and help you prepare to collaborate with other developers. You'll learn how to use Github Projects to manage your project and demonstrate some of your new Agile knowledge.

At the end of Week 10, you'll present your Front-End Project to the class in the form of a demo.
