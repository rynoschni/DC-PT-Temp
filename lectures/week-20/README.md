# Week 20

Week 20! We're going to take a look at Redux, a tool to help manage state in a JavaScript application. You may have seen Redux around the internet, typically in conjunction with React. We're going to learn how to use Redux on its own first, and then we're going to learn how to integrate it with a React application.
