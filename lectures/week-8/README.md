# Week 8

In week 8, we'll focus on techniques for enhancing our web pages functionally and visually using JavaScript libraries and CSS. 

This is the on-ramp to your first project, which will be your Front-End Project! By this point you should feel comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you do not feel comfortable with any of those - no worries! That is 100% normal and expected. Often, its not until your first project that you start to feel things _click_. Stick with it, and ask questions!
