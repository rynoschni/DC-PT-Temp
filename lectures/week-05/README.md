# Week 5

Week 5! Here is where things start getting interesting - we're going to start dealing with user input, and browser events.

Remember JavaScript? This week we're going to learn how JavaScript, HTML, and a little CSS come together to make the modern web.  If that sounds like a lot - it is! But don't worry. We're going to do an easy re-entry into JavaScript and then start building bridges as we go. We'll also start exploring how to deploy your code to AWS.
