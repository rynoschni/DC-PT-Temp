# Week 11

Congratulations on completing your Front-End Project! To start the week, you'll be demoing your front-end projects for the class.

This week marks a departure from front-end development. We will still be using everything you've learned so far, but the focus of our study will be on back-end development. We'll start with a brief re-introduction to Node, and experiment with node modules using `npm`.
