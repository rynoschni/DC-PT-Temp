# Week 24

Welcome to Week 24! 

We're going to start with your React Project demos, and then learn a little more about how to deploy projects to AWS. This is also the last week of instruction before your final Capstone Project weeks. 

If you haven't already come up with an idea for your Capstone Project - this is the week to do it. You want to start next week fresh, with an actionable idea, and ready to get to work.
