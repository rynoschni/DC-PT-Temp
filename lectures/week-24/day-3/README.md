# Week 24 - Day 3

Welcome to Week 24!

## Agenda

- We'll spend the remainder of the week deploying our projects to AWS
- This is a great time to tidy up any projects that you want to put on your portfolio or in your resume and make sure they are deployed

## Where to find stuff
- /notes - This will include any example code or notes created during class so you can always go back and review
- RESOURCES.md - Any relevant resources for the current day in class
