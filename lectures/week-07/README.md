# Week 7

Here in week 7, we're going to continue building upon our foundational skills. We'll explore how to build interactive user interfaces in the browser. We'll also learn how to connect our web pages to other services on the internet, and how to get different types of data for our web pages. We'll have lots of practice this week, so be prepared to code.
