# Week 6

Here we go with Week 6!

This week we're going to take what we've learned about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and learn how to handle user input. Building forms and dealing with user input is a big part of Front End Development, and we're going to make sure you get started with these problems the right way. We'll also begin learning how to deploy code to Amazon Web Services (AWS).
